# FortiWeb Autoscale
A collection of **Node.js** modules and cloud-specific templates which support basic autoscale functionality for groups of FortiWeb VM instances on various cloud platforms.

This project contains the code and templates for the **Amazon AWS** and **Microsoft Azure** autoscale deployments.

This project is organized in separate node modules:
 * [fortiweb-autoscale/core](core) contains the core logic and provides an interface which can be extended to deal with the differences in cloud platform APIs.
 * [fortiweb-autoscale/azure](azure) contains an implementation for the **Microsoft Azure** platform API and **Cosmos DB** storage backend.
 * [fortiweb-autoscale/aws](aws) contains an implementation for the **AWS SDK** platform API with a **Dynamo DB** storage backend.

The project also contains a deployment script which can generate packages for each cloud service's *serverless* implementation.
